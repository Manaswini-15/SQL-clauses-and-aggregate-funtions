SQL Aggregate Functions:
SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column.
Useful aggregate functions:
•AVG() - Returns the average value
•COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
•FIRST() - Returns the first value
•LAST() - Returns the last value
•MAX() - Returns the largest value
•MIN() - Returns the smallest value
•SUM() - Returns the sum


The AVG() Function:
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric
column.
SQL AVG() Syntax
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name

Examples:
1)
  SELECT AVG(cost) AS "Average Cost" FROM sweets
WHERE category = 'Jelabi';
   Here in this example, the average cost is displayed using cost column from sweets table where category is jelabi.
2)
SELECT AVG(price) FROM SHOP;
 
   Here in this example, the average price is displayed using price column from SHOP table.

  
 COUNT() function:
 The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.
 SQL COUNT(column_name) Syntax
The COUNT(column_name) function returns the number of values
(NULL values will not be counted) of the specified column:
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name

Examples:
1) 
   SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
   FROM Products;
   Here in this example,the count function returns number of rows with productid from Products table.
   
2)
  SELECT count(sweet_id) FROM sweets
  WHERE category="jelabi";
  Here, in this example the number of  sweet ids are returned by count function from sweets table where category is jelabi.
  
 3)SELECT COUNT(price) FROM SHOP;
  here in this example, the count funtion returns number of rows in price from SHOP table.


SUM() function:
Syntax: SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name

Examples:
 1)
 SELECT SUM(Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  here in this example, the sum function returns Quantity  sum from OrderDetails.
 2)
   SELECT SUM(price)
  FROM SHOP;
   here in this example, the sum funtion returns  sum of the price from SHOP table.
  
  
 MAX() function:
 Syntax: SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name

 Examples:
 1)
  SELECT MAX(Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  here in this example, the max function returns  max Quantity  from OrderDetails.
 2)
   SELECT MAX(price)
  FROM SHOP;
   here in this example, the max funtion returns max price from SHOP table.


 MIN() function:
 Syntax: SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name

 Examples:
 1)
  SELECT MIN(Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  here in this example, the min function returns minimum Quantity  from OrderDetails.
 2)
   SELECT MIN(price)
  FROM SHOP;
   here in this example, the min funtion returns minimum price from SHOP table.
   
   
  FIRST() function:
  Syntax: SELECT FIRST(column_name) FROM table_name

 Examples:
 1)
  SELECT FIRST(Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  here in this example, the first function returns  first Quantity from OrderDetails.
 2)
   SELECT FIRST(price)
   FROM SHOP;
   here in this example, the first funtion returns first price from SHOP table.
   
   
   LAST() function:
   Syntax: SELECT LAST(column_name) FROM table_name

   Examples:
    1)
      SELECT LAST(Quantity)
      FROM OrderDetails;
  here in this example, the last function returns  last Quantity from OrderDetails.
    2)
     SELECT LAST(price)
     FROM SHOP;
   here in this example, the last funtion returns last price from SHOP.
  Hence, this are the aggregate functions in SQL.
